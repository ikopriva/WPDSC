The code in this folder allows to reproduce the simulation results in the paper ``Robust Subspace Clustering via Thresholding'' by Reinhard Heckel and Helmut BÃ¶lcskei

Requirements:

- matlab
- make
- pdflatex



To generate Figures 1-5, change to directory synthetic_data and then to the directory of the corresponding figure, and execute the makefile there by typing make into a terminal shell. 

By default, Figures 2-5 are generated with a coarser resolution and a reduced number of problem instances, in order to test the code and obtain the corresponding figure in short time.
In order to generate the figures in their original resolution, as they appear in the paper, the original parameters in the corresponding .m file, that are currently commented out, have to be commented in. 

Figure 7 contains a comparison of SSC and TSC. 
To generate Figures 5-6, first download the SSC implementaion from 

http://www.cis.jhu.edu/~ehsan/Codes/SSC_ADMM_v1.1.zip

and unzip the file in the directory of this readme-file. 
Executing make in the folder clustering_digits will generate Figure 6-7. 
Note that this folder contains the functions loadMNISTImages.m and loadMNISTLabels.m, taken from
